# FTL-saving
[Faster Than Light](http://www.ftlgame.com/) â€” is a great game, but from the box it doesn't provide a possibility to save your game.
Sometimes you want to try flying different ways or make different decisions.

Fortunately you can just backup your savings in the safe place with this small script.

## Install

1. Copy `save.sh` wherever you want.
2. Configure your FTL path and path for your savings
3. Don't forget to grant execution permissions: `sudo chmod +x save.sh`

## Usage

1. List your savings:

    ```
    ./save.sh list
    ```
2. Back up your saving:

    ```
    ./save.sh save [tag]
    ```
    All your savings can be tagged with specific name or with consistent numbers by default.
3. Restore your saving:

    ```
    ./save.sh load <tag>
    ```
4. Retag your backup:

    ```
    ./save.sh tag <oldtag> <newtag>
    ```
5. Restore last saving:

    ```
    ./save.sh restore
    ```
